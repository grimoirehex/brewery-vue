# Brewery-Vue
```
This application demonstrates the usage of the VUE javascript framework
combined with the Open Brewery Database to provide location details for specific breweries in a select city.
```
## Azure
```
Azure is used to host the application.
It is also used to host a custom API which demonstrates that the code functions even when not accessing the 
Open Brewery DB - https://www.openbrewerydb.org
